# Duplicated tuning kit ID finder, created by: SM mest3r (https://smmest3r.dev/ https://mest3rdevelopment.com/)

A simple windows and linux compatible python code that scans the carcols.meta files in the cars folder. 

If the cars are scattered in your resources folder, you can also choose the resources folder when selecting a folder, but that is the less optimized solution. If the code finds a duplicate tuning ID, it will print the ID and the location of the carcols.meta files.
